Final Project

## About
One of my interests is cooking and baking. Using the right measurements can make or break a recipe. Often, I cannot recall conversions at my fingertips. I created a **Cooking and Baking Unit Converter** that converts common units of measurement.

Please see the PDF summary for more information on the project, run `main.py` to use the Converter, and run `unit_test.py` to run unit tests.
